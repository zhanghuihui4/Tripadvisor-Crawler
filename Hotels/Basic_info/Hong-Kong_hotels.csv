Standing between Tai Mo Shan mountain and the Rambler Channel, it was originally planned to be the world’s tallest building. However, its proximity to the airport flightpath led to it becoming the two sparkling sister towers of today. This Nina’s location is packed with appeals. Firstly, getting here is easy. It’s less than 20 minutes by road from Central, Tsim Sha Tsui is a 12 minute train ride, and the international airport is 25 minutes by the highway. So you see, it’s an efficient base from which to explore. But be warned, you may not want to leave.
