Our room was pleasant with a comfortable sitting area. The hotel is situated away from the busy area of Hong Kong Island and you had to catch a ferry to get into town. This worked well for us as we were in Hong Kong for almost a week. We were very near Lantau Island and Disneyland. If you are only staying a few days you might want to be more centrally located- for us it was great to be staying at a quieter area. The hotel staff were very helpful. We enjoyed the buffet breakfasts which were well stocked with fresh food. Being a family of four with two older boys we were particularly pleased with the free wifi.

I just randomly chose Auberge because it's near Disney Park. I arrived in midnight and fell sleep soon. When I woke up, tore the curtain aside, it is rather refreshing to see the sea view as well as the mountain view since my room is located at the corner of the building. After the exhausting visit in Disney with me nephew crazy about dark and bright roller coaster, we took the hotel shuttle bus back to Auberge. It's also very convenient if u want to go to Central. U may take D4 or D9 to DB pier. And thanks to Cathy for keeping my green backpack. One thing to improve: When I asked the staff later in the night whether anybody see my backpack, he firmly said no.

We had an 'Ocean Front Deluxe' room, with (small) balcony, which was great. Very comfortable and clean. It seems only a few rooms have balconies, which is a shame, because I'm sure the balcony makes a big difference if the weather is good (it was for us, early December) and you are not rushing off to Disneyland, Giant Buddha, or whatever. It would be even nicer if there were a couple of small chairs on the balcony! Good view of the ocean/harbour, nearby hills, distant islands (on a clear day!), Disneyland fireworks (every night).

There was a strong smell of cigarette smoke in the corridor. Neither we nor other guests heard any alarm. There was no evacuation of the building.

Sadly the burger bun was burned to the point that it overpowered the salmon pattie and had to be returned along with the chips which were marginally undercooked.

Cant even share with a 2 year old kid. Breakfast is included in the room rate (original price if remember correctly is approx HKD170 each person). Choice of food items not great but acceptable. Did not try their cafe for lunch or dinner but had a look at the menu. Everything appears to be quite expensive. Staffs are firendly and helpful.

I very much appreciate your detailed post regarding your stay on tripadvisor. We apologise that you encountered some problems during your stay. In relation to the late check out (subject to availability), the availability of our guest rooms were limited upon your departure, therefore we were only able to offer 1pm. We do provide cots for children free-of-charge and I am sorry if this was not communicated to you upon check-in. As this would have given you some extra comfort in your bed. Café bord de Mer will be unveiling its weekend buffets and brunches soon, in the meantime, the a la carte menu is available together with sumptuous daily specials. Your comments on the housekeeping service are very well noted and we are following these up closely with the teams involved. I was delighted to read that my team were friendly and helpful during your stay as we are all totally dedicated to making our guest experiences truly memorable.

We enjoy our stay here but I didn't feel anything special. The place is nice and clean and it smells like paint but its understandable cause they just open a month ago. The staff still trying to find their footing and what they supposed to do. Our check in was not handled efficiently so we have to wait for 30 mins at the lobby, Good thing they provide a welcome drink so we went ahead to the coffee shop while waiting. The room is not so huge for standard room and it look crowded with a big sofa set inside. Bed is comfy, amenities are ample. Huge shower rooms and nice comfort room. Staff are pretty helpful but annoyingly eager to serve you. I guess cause they are not busy during weekdays and they don't really have anything to…",April 2013,"Response from Anne B, General Manager at Auberge Discovery Bay Hong Kong

The staying experience was really great! I particularly satisfied with the staff here they are well trained and helpful. I got a seaview room with a spectacular seaview which is out of my expectation. The hotel provided a baby bed for my daughter who fit in so well and comfortable. The room is spacious despite one extra baby bed and the extra large sofa. The room is well equipped with all the necessary facilities. I enjoyed the breakfast the next day of stay, buffet with plenty of choice of good taste.

The staff were really friendly (the people on reception were great), and the breakfast was excellent value. It is convenient enough for HK airport, as well as links to Penny Bay on the MTR.

To get there, it's very easy, either you can take a direct ferry from Central (pier 3) to Discovery Bay, or take the train to Sunny Bay, and then take the bus to Hotel Auberge Discovery Bay, which will take you another 5-8 min. It's just like a paradise, everything there's so 'ocean' feel. I especially like the white chapel, which looks so romantic and for sure, couples to arrange a wedding there will be fantastic. Feel so good to stay in their ocean view room. They do have a restaurant there - I specially like the fresh oyster and salmon burger~ ^o^ But there are few more restaurants near hotel and more restaurants…",March 2013,"Response from Anne B, General Manager at Auberge Discovery Bay Hong Kong
