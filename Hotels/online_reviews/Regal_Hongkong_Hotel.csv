https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juntan1967,Juntan1967 wrote a review Aug 23,,1 contribution,,f,10,The worst hotel yet!,"I've been traveling around the world and your hotel is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Your rooms are so antiquated and the beds are so hard. You have only one(1) electrical outlet in the room. How can a hotel room have only one(1) electrical outlet. You can't even provide adapters for us to use with HK outlets.

The lounge service is terrible, The lounge opens at 12nn and it closes at 8pm, which is kinda stupid since it's supposed to be a meeting area for your guests any time of the day. When you pass 745pm. They would tell you to leave and we should leave our unfinished drinks on the table. When we wanted to get water and bring them to our room, They would not allow us, they informed us that we should call the front desk to ask for water. When we called the front desk for six(6) bottles of water to be brought up to the room, they refused, they will only provide us four(4) bottles. Is that how you treat your hotel guests? If we didn't stay at your executive floors, How poorly would you treat your regular guests.

Your drinks selection are terrible. How can you serve cheap liquor to your VIP's.

Your Buffet area is big but the food is unappetizing and unpalatable.

Overall, It was a horrendous experience for me and my children. I refuse to stay in your hotel in the future. There are so many hotels that would give us way better quality and service with the same amount of money.

At the present situation around the globe, hygiene is the highest priority in every aspect especially for a hotel. In addition, maintaining a good condition of room’s fixture also play an important role for us to compete with other hotels within the area.

Many shops and restaurants around. We booked a club room which was worth the extra to have breakfast in a different restaurant very quiet and tranquil, also use of the club lounge with beverages, snacks and alcohol 6-8pm. Also the shuttle airport bus is included if you can marry the times to your flights. We paid for a taxi on arrival but used the bus for the return which saved us £55.00. They also brought a cake for my birthday which was a lovely gesture and sorry we didnt eat all of it.

You are correct, we do not have and iron & ironing boards in the rooms, because we offer a 24 hr valet pressing service. Iron & ironing boards are available should guest specifically require them. I was glad to read you enjoyed the views from our 35th floor swimming pool. To have such a pool in the heart of the city, with views of the Harbour is something unique and something we are very proud of. I am sorry the water was not to your liking, as is common with most swimming pools in Hong Kong, due to generally high year round ambient temperature the pool is unheated. There is plenty of seating in the lobby, I am sorry you were put off by some of the signage, that is purely advisory for none hotel guest, due to our location we do attract a lot of walk in visitors.

The staff is very friendly and helpful - Really appreciate the front desk team giving us a couple of tips on some local restaurants we weren’t familiar with. Room was spacious, clean and super comfy - as it was our last few nights in HK, we upgraded and it was worth the few extra dollars. The view from the restaurant is stunning - and the food was great - not quite Michelin-star, but beautifully presented and tasty too! Love that the chef came out to make sure everything was okay and recommended a fab wine (great wine list to choose from).

First of all, please accept our sincere apologies for the unsatisfied experience regarding the mishandling your credit card authorization. After review there was a delay from our side, once we received the reservation, to process payment – and this resulted in the team member at Front Desk asking for credit card verification again upon your arrival at the hotel. It was a failure from our side to process the reservation properly. It was not intentional but I fully appreciate the confusion that we created with this situation and the concerns that you would experience with the feeling that you were being charged twice. This would never happen – but I accept the perception would have been quite real in this case. The credit card authorization amount requested upon check has been sent back to the bank for cancellation. Secondly, our Engineering Team has inspected all the air-conditioning system and adjusted the temperature of our guestroom in accordance with the guidelines. Your review helps us constantly enhance our services and facilities. Thirdly, I would like to assure you that I have personally addressed the issue of the service attitude to our concerned staff and will ensure that they receive the necessary guidance to perform better to avoid a similar recurrence.

It took 3 days & 5 people to fix it. The Nepresso Machine didn't work & despite reporting, it wasn't replaced, the spa bath didn't work & the titles around the large spa bath were ""No Gapped"" up with silastic gunk.

Price is very reasonable and at the executive rooms ie level 32 and above, some rooms have sea view and the moment you step into the room you would definitely feel like a king. Although many locals have told me that it's very old but now I understand they don't mean it's not maintained and run down, they just mean it's one of the oldest HK hotel for many many years. One downside is the breakfast, to me it's not up to standard but breakfast can be found easily outside of the hotel.

Lounge had decent pastries and drinks, while the breakfast was above average, though i would prefer if the selections were changed daily (i had the same sausages, bacon, hash brown, porridge for 2 days running). Rooms were clean and comfortable and i particularly loved the choices of pillows.

I was disappointed with the service and value for money. As noted in other reviews there can be very long wait times at reception. Staff I dealt with were not overly friendly and at times bordering on rude (one receptionist abruptly ended a conversation I was having about my booking by picking up the phone and serving someone else). The rate I was charged was different (i.e. higher) to the rate advised by my travel agent. I was told to take it up with my travel agent when I got home. While the location is good, this is an average hotel. Rooms are OK but dated and tired, and need of some freshening up. Air conditioning was noisy and had to be turned off at night to sleep.

When you leave the room and remove the hotel room keycard from the power slot, this will inadvertently turn off the light for the do not disturb signage but apparently not right away. So when you leave, you still see the light on but after 10-15 seconds it turns off and housekeeping will come in and clean. This is sooooooo misleading. We left valuables out in plain view bc we thought no one would enter the room since the do not disturb sign was on. What kind of trickery is this?

Advantages of the Exec Floor are that if you get one of the really large rooms they are very nice and a definite improvement on the standard rooms. However on my second stay I would not rate the room I had on this floor as any different to the Standard rooms except with the addition of L'Occitane toiletries. The room was pretty small and no different in quality. Breakfast on the Exec Floor is nice - as good a choice as the main restaurant but a more relaxed atmosphere and good view.

When we went down to my parents' room after a day out around the city, we found a cigarette butt in their room. Seems like the one cleaning the room was smoking.

I booked the 'Free breakfast offer' that was, ironically, a pop-up window here on Tripadvisor. Whilst the hotel is in a convenient location (Times Sq, Victoria Park and the C'way Bay MTR station just a stones throw away), it's the complete lack of inflexibility, pettiness and quite frankly appalling customer service that lets this establishment down hugely.

I realise most guests want to get to their room as soon as possible but when there is going to be a longer delay, we do encourage guests to leave their luggage with us whilst they make better use of their time rather than waiting. I am sorry that we did not alert you to this possibility. The hair in the bathroom is not a standard that we are proud of and more effort is being made to ensure all rooms are properly checked before arrival.

I am pleased you generally had a good stay but I was sorry to learn that you did not get a warm reception at the Front Desk. This has been taken up with the Front Office team to remind them to be more welcoming. The hotel has quite a lot of old style features to it, some of which we will keep but many of them, especially in the rooms, are being updated to reflect a more modern look. Next time you visit, ask for one of the newly refurbished rooms and I hope we can give you a more memorable stay.
