We stayed for 2 nights as we were able to avail the special discount of 35% off. The hotel itself is really great. From the very spacious lobby, very plenty of rooms up to 8 floors, really big garden, nice amenities. Of course the gift shop at the lobby, and dining options at the 2nd floor.

The theme I guess for the gift shop is about Duffy and Friends. We bought some souvenir items - but honestly, we wished that there should've been more options to choose from (like from our experience before at gift shop in Disney's Hollywood hotel way back 2019).

We dined at Chart Room Cafe for lunch, take out for dinner, and breakfast the following morning. It's quite expensive though, but for experience, its worth the try.

As for the amenities, the garden is really nice. But our favorite was the pool! We weren't able to try the Disney Hollywood hotel pool before. That's why we see to it we try the pool here in Explorer's lodge. And wow - what a wonderful experience! Water is really comfortably warm. Good for families. How we love to stay there for longer period next time.

Our only regret though was that we did not encounter any Disney charaters during our 2 night stay at the hotel. Hope we will see them next time.

Overall, our experience at Disney's Explorers Lodge is wonderful and worth coming back again. A dream come true and a big check on our bucketlist. Should there be another opportunity to stay at a Disney hotel in Hong Kong, Explorer's Lodge will definitely on top of our list.

Thank you, everyone has been nice to us during our stay.

If you come on your birthday, you'll receive ""Happy Birthday"" badge as well as you get in Hong Kong Disneyland Park with another version in the park. Cast members say ""Happy Birthday"" when they see this badge. It quite impressed me with heartwarming so much.

This place, cast members and purchased decorations had made my day with warmth welcome and service, especially for my birthday.

Room is well-decorated, kids-friendly, lovely and safe. Amenities is also lovely and good, especially amenities box. But I can't find the bed lamp switch.

But will try to be as objective as i can and not compare the 2 hotels :)

Disney is Disney. We chose to stay here for the kids to experience the magic of disney. THe staff were nice. Check in was relatively smooth coz we arrived before the hoards of other guests came. Check out was a breeze as they just ask you to leave the keys in the drop box.

They have 2 big 1.5 Liters of bottled water. This is such a plus for us as we are big water drinkers. These bottles, you can also bring to the park. And they replenished our water supply the next day.

Coffee is nescafe and creamer is the liquid coffee mate (i appreciate this because i love liquid creamers). I dont however, like nescafe instant. (sorry, couldnt help but compare to Gateway's Nespresso machine)

They also have an ice machine. We got the 2 day park tickets and the ice machine was such a life saver. We filled our bottles with ice so we had ice cold water in the park. SUCH a life saver because it was SOOOOOOO hot in the park.

The restaurants are, as expected, pricey. BUT it was such a pleasant surprise that the food tasted good. Chart cafe's food is good. the ribs were actually a good value at HKD149. pizza was too expensive at almost 300 hkd tho.

Play area is ok, kids enjoyed.

Happy that they had some disney channels tho i didnt realize right away that the movies were just on loop the whole day.

Thankful that the staff granted our request to have a room with a nook, however, our room was too far from the elevators. The hotel is HUGE and there are soooo many rooms.

The beautiful gardens make for a nice walk, too. We were here during the holiday times, as well. The hotel was festive and decorated beautifully (and appropriately explorer themed).

Check in time also took quite a while even though there was no one in line in front of us.

Our last trip was in 2016, when the Explorers Hotel was under construction. For this trip in April of 2019 we decided to check out the new place, and are we glad we did! The small touches of theming make this a place full of surprise and delight. From the binocular shaped hallway lights to the elevator cars themed as hot air balloon baskets, this hotel is full of whimsical touches. The rooms are spacious - especially by Hong Kong standards - and the accommodations excellent. We found some of the restaurant offerings to be on the pricey side, but not out of line with similar eating establishments at Disney. Overall, the Explorers Lodge has become one of our new Disney favorites.",April 2019,"Response from DELG85, Resident Manager at Disney Explorers Lodge

This is not Disney thrown in your face like other Disney hotels. It is subtle and clever. From the compass on the spindles in the shower to the oversized 'luggage' coffee tables in the foyer. The rooms are simpke, clean and big enough for family. The bathroom is small but clean and showers are hot. The pool area is nice and was a good way for us to break up our two days at Disneyland park. The breakfast had alot of variety and was very kid friendly. The character breakfast is lots of fun.
